# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

Our project focuses on the development of an online store that effectively simulates a fully functional e-commerce platform, incorporating user-friendly features such as product listings, shopping carts, user registration and user reviews. The system, built on Python, Flask, and SQLite, serves to facilitate a comprehensive learning experience by emulating a e-commerce website. Our stakeholders comprise administrators who require a robust backend for managing the store, sellers who need an efficient platform to showcase their products, and customers who expect a seamless and intuitive shopping experience. This project aims to provide a practical and integrated demonstration of our acquired skills in software engineering.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** R1
  - **Description:** User friendly interface
  - **Type:** Non-Functional.
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** The system should provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface to ensure ease of use and a positive user experience.
  - **Testing:** Through usability testing representing various common user profiles.
- **ID:** R2
  - **Description:** Allow users to reset an existing password.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** The user must be able to reset an existing password to ensure user security and access in the case that a password is lost.
  - **Testing:** By implementing a password reset flow and testing it by attempting to reset a user's password.
- **ID:** R3
  - **Description:** Shopping cart functionality
  - **Type:** Functional.
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** The system should provide a shopping cart for users to add and remove items before final purchase, so that making multiple purchases at the same time is more convenient.
  - **Testing:** By adding and removing items from the shopping cart and checking if the cart updates correctly, then checking out and ensuring all items in the cart are properly purchased.
- **ID:** R4
  - **Description:** System Stability
  - **Type:** Non-Functional.
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** The system should be able to support at least X concurrent users to ensure system scalability.
  - **Testing:** By conducting load testing to simulate multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
- **ID:** R5
  - **Description:** Order history
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** User must be able to view their order history to allow for transparency and record-keeping.
  - **Testing:** By placing an order and checking if it appears in the user's order history. 
- **ID:** R6
  - **Description:** System Effeciency
  - **Type:** Non-Functional.
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:**  The system should load product pages within 3 seconds to provide a good user experience.
  - **Testing:** By timing the loading of various product pages.

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

- **ID:** C1
  - **Description:**  Language and Framework Constraint: The project's template code is written using Python and Flask, which limits the backend development to these technologies.
- **ID:** C2
  - **Description:**  Database Constraint: The project is restricted to using SQLite for data storage, which might not be suitable for extremely large databases or high concurrency applications.
- **ID:** C3
  - **Description:**  Time Constraint: The project must be completed within the summer semester, which limits the amount of functionality that can be implemented and thoroughly tested.
- **ID:** C4
  - **Description:**  Resource Constraint: Being a student project, there are limitations in terms of financial resources, potentially impacting the procurement of third-party services, APIs, or development tools.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** UC1
  - **Description:** User logs in to the system.
  - **Actors:** User.
  - **Preconditions:** User has a registered account and is not currently logged in.
  - **Postconditions:** User is logged in to the system, and has access to their account information and history.
- **ID:** UC2
  - **Description:** User searches for a product
  - **Actors:** User.
  - **Preconditions:** User is accesing the store and uses the search feature
  - **Postconditions:** The system displays search results matching the user's query
- **ID:** UC3
  - **Description:** User adds product to the shopping cart
  - **Actors:** User.
  - **Preconditions:** User is logged in, product exists in inventory, and sufficient quantity is available
  - **Postconditions:** The product is added to the user's shopping cart
- **ID:** UC4
  - **Description:** User checks out and makes a purchase
  - **Actors:** User.
  - **Preconditions:**  User is logged in, has items in their cart, and has a valid method of payment
  - **Postconditions:** The order is placed, inventory is updated, user's order history is updated

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **ID:** US1
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** As a customer, I want to be able to easily search for products so that I can find what I'm looking for quickly and efficiently.
- **ID:** US2
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** As a customer, I want to add products to my cart and checkout easily so that I can make purchases without any hassle.
- **ID:** US3
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** As a customer, I want to be able to review products I have purchased so I can share my experiences and help other customers.
- **ID:** US4
  - **Type of User:** Admin
  - **Description:** As an admin, I want to be able to add, remove, or update product inventory so the store always shows accurate and up-to-date products.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Term:** Flask
  - **Definition:** A lightweight web application framework for Python
- **Term:** Concurrent Users
  - **Definition:** The total number of users who are accessing the system at the same time.

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.
